# Tensorflow Requirements For RTX 2070

This project provides a curated list of Python dependencies optimized for compatibility and performance on systems equipped with RTX 2070 GPUs, primarily targeted for Tensorflow projects.

## Overview
The repository includes a `requirements.txt` file containing essential Python packages and their versions tailored specifically for RTX 2070 GPUs. These dependencies are carefully selected to ensure seamless integration and optimal performance with Tensorflow-based projects.

## Usage
To use the provided requirements file:

1. Install the requirements using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dependencies
The `requirements.txt` file includes the following important dependencies along with their versions:

- **Tensorflow (2.3.0)**
- **Tensorflow-GPU (2.3.0)**
- **NumPy (1.18.5)**
- **SciPy (1.4.1)**
- **scikit-learn (1.2.2)**
- **matplotlib (3.5.3)**
- **pandas (1.4.4)**
- **opencv-python (4.9.0.80)**
- **requests (2.31.0)**
- **Keras-Preprocessing (1.1.2)**
- **keras-tuner (1.3.3)**

Ensure that your Python environment meets these dependencies for smooth execution of Tensorflow projects on RTX 2070 GPUs.

And ensure that you must install the corresponding version of `CUDA` and `cuDNN` for Tensorflow to work properly.
